# Codespace development

Instead of installing various command line tools and libraries locally, sometimes it is more convenient to login to a web-based dev environment that is pre-configured. [`devcontainers`](https://containers.dev/)[^1] using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)[^2] are one such option.
