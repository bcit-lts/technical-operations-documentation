# How to deploy an app

Deploying is automatic when a commit is made to a project's `main` branch and the CI/CD pipeline is triggered.

The pipeline builds and versions the app image, signs and pushes the image to GitHub's package registry, and then updates a Helm chart repository with the new version. If `cdn_enabled=true`, the pipeline also rewrites static asset URLs in the image to use a CDN, and uploads those assets to a CDN.

## 1. Checkout & Versioning

1. Source repo is checked out.
1. [`semantic-release`](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/) inspects commits and determines if this is a formal release.
1. App version is computed:
    - Release :lucide-arrow-right: uses the `semantic-release` version.
    - Release candidate (RC) :lucide-arrow-right: generates a timestamp-based RC version.

## 2. Build Image

1. App image is built (not pushed).
1. Image is tagged with:
    - the computed version
    - stable (for releases)
    - latest

    If `cdn_enabled=true`:

    **3a. Validate CDN configuration**

    - Ensures required CDN variables and Azure token exist.

    **3b. Extract static files**

    - Creates a temporary container from the built image.
    - Copies `/usr/share/nginx/html` into `site/`.

    **3c. Compute CDN asset version**

    - Collects files matching configured extensions (css, js, png, etc.).
    - Hashes all matching files :lucide-arrow-right: produces a CDN asset version.
    - This version becomes part of the CDN path.

    **3d. Rewrite HTML asset URLs**

    - All `<img>`, `<script>`, `<link>` references that match the extensions are rewritten to:

        `<CDN_BASE_URL>/cdn/bcit-ltc/<app>/<asset_version>/<assets>`

    **3e. Commit rewritten files back into the container**

    - Copies rewritten files back into the runtime image.
    - Commits the container :lucide-arrow-right: final app image (with CDN references baked in).

    **3f. Upload assets to CDN**

    - Checks asset hash against the CDN folders to determine if asset version already exists.

    - If yes :lucide-arrow-right: skip upload.
    - If no :lucide-arrow-right: upload assets.

## 4. Push & Sign

- All computed image tags are pushed to GHCR.
- The workflow resolves their digests.
- Each unique digest is signed using cosign.

## 5. Helm Chart Update

- A GitHub App token is generated.
- A remote workflow in the helm-charts repo is triggered to bump the chart version to match the new image version.
